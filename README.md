## Description

This is a refactoring project to updated the code for a React MERN ECommerce Shop to utilise React Redux. Formerly the code uses React's useReducer, createContext and useContext Hook Methods to pass props data. Refactoring this using Redux allows the data to be accessed in globally by prop drilling instead of threading, that is, passing information down hierarchically through multiple components with props.
